# Countdown Timer with Flipping Digits

This project is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation of a countdown timer using flipping digits. The timer counts down to a specific date and time while visually displaying the countdown in hours, minutes, and seconds using animated flipping cards.

## Project Structure

### Files

- *`index.html`*: Contains the structure of the countdown timer.
- *`style.css`*: Stylesheet defining the appearance of the countdown timer.
- *`script.js`*: JavaScript logic for the countdown functionality and flipping animation.

### HTML Structure

- The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the countdown timer.
- Uses div elements with appropriate classes to define the segments for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Each segment contains individual flip cards displaying tens and ones place values.

### CSS Styling

- The CSS file (`style.css`) provides the necessary styles for the flipping cards and the overall layout.
- Defines the appearance and animation of the flipping digits.

### JavaScript Logic

- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) manages the countdown functionality and flipping animation.
- Retrieves countdown target date and calculates the time difference.
- Updates the flipping cards' digits every 250 milliseconds to reflect the remaining time.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the countdown timer in action.
3. The timer counts down to a specific date (24 hours from the current time).

## Running the Timer

The timer automatically starts running when the HTML file is opened in a web browser. It calculates the time remaining until the target date and continuously updates the displayed digits.

## Customization

- To change the target date, modify the `countToDate` variable in `script.js`.
- Adjust the styles in `style.css` to customize the appearance of the countdown timer as desired.

## Notes

- The flipping animation creates a visual effect by flipping the digits to display the updated time.
- Ensure that all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) are present in the same directory for proper functionality.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code to suit your needs!
